# NoiseReduction
Whenever we are dealing to computer vision projects there is always an problem of smooth output(noise reducation). So to deal with it there is noise reduction step and here in this project were are going to access photo from two different folders simultaneously(Multithreading by Gaussian filter) and output will be stored in the two different folders

create two new folders named as output1 and output2 (or as you wish, just make sure that folder name and path inside the code should be same)
